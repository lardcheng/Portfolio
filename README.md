# Portfolio

Hi there!
Welcome to my portfolio where I try to showcase all of my projects, SQL codes, and dashboards.

If you haven't already, please feel free to also check out my Notion Project Portfolio, where I showcase my data visualization projects!

# SQL

| Project Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Contracts Code](https://github.com/lardcheng/Contracts-Code)| My first dashboard I created and managed during my time at my first corporate position. This was originally created in Power BI and connected to a Sharepoint list, but I've recreated it with sample data in SQL in order to showcase it. |
| [MCU Profitability and Performance Code](https://github.com/lardcheng/MCU-Profitability-Project)| A personal project that allowed me to flex my creativity and work with a topic that I deeply enjoyed. This project was Power BI heavy, with minimal work done in SQL. The objective of this project was to perform a high-level analysis on the performance and profitability of each MCU phase and film. |
| [Zerious Zoccer Zone Database](https://github.com/lardcheng/Zerious-Zoccer-Zone-Project)| As part of a consulting team, we are hired by a local business to create a comprehensive database for them in order to meet the demands of the growing industry they operate in. They have certain business requirements that need to be met. |
