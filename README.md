# Portfolio

Hi there!
Welcome to my portfolio where I try to showcase all of my projects, SQL codes, and dashboards.

If you haven't already, please feel free to also check out my Notion Project Portfolio, where I showcase my data visualization projects! Those projects are linked below. 

# SQL
| Project Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Zerious Zoccer Zone Database](https://github.com/lardcheng/Zerious-Zoccer-Zone-Project)| As part of a consulting team, we are hired by a local business to create a comprehensive database for them in order to meet the demands of the growing industry they operate in. They have certain business requirements that need to be met. |

| [Contracts Dashboard](https://lardcheng.notion.site/Contracts-Dashboard-4042c67c3db2481dbf02918ed1a4ec4d)| My first ever dashboard created in Power BI. It has gone through several stages of editing, and I am extremely proud of how the most recent version turned out. This dashboard was created in order to give viewers a snapshot of the performance of the contracts and compliance department within the Capital Programs team. |
