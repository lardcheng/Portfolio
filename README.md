# Portfolio

Hi there!
Welcome to my portfolio where I try to showcase all of my projects, SQL codes, and dashboards.

If you haven't already, please feel free to also check out my Notion Project Portfolio, where I showcase my data visualization projects!

# SQL

| Project Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Contracts Code](https://github.com/lardcheng/Contracts-Code)| My first dashboard I created and managed during my time at my first corporate position. This was originally created in Power BI and connected to a SharePoint list, but I've recreated it with sample data in SQL in order to showcase it. |
| [Zerious Zoccer Zone Database](https://github.com/lardcheng/Zerious-Zoccer-Zone-Project)| As part of a consulting team, we are hired by a local business to create a comprehensive database for them in order to meet the demands of the growing industry they operate in. They have certain business requirements that need to be met. |

# Dashboards
| Project Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Contracts Dashboard](https://lardcheng.notion.site/Contracts-Dashboard-4042c67c3db2481dbf02918ed1a4ec4d)| Dashboard for the above Contracts Code. |
| [Contracts Dashboard v2.0](https://lardcheng.notion.site/Contracts-Dashboard-v2-0-1e751742cf8a4548844176d61daac77f)| Second version of the Contracts Dashboard. This version features a revamped style as well as different visuals. This version does not use the SQL code as the previous one does, and uses actual data from the original SharePoint list. Certain data is redacted. |
